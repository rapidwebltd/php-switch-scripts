These scripts are designed to aid in the setup of and switching between multiple PHP versions in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or newer.

Please note that these scripts install packages from a third-party repository, provided by [Ondřej Surý](https://twitter.com/oerdnj). More details are available at the repository's [website](https://deb.sury.org/), [PPA page on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php/) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/debsuryorg).

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 14.04.* LTS or newer
* Apache 2.4.*

You can check you have the required versions by running the following command.

```
lsb_release -a | grep Ubuntu && apache2 -v | grep Apache
```

You should see something similar to the below.

```
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
Server version: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
```

## Setup

First, clone the repository, and change directory if you have not already done so.

```
git clone https://github.com/rapidwebltd/php-switch-scripts.git
cd php-switch-scripts
```

Next, to setup all the supported PHP versions and common PHP extensions for them, you just need to run the `setup.sh` script. This is shown below.

```
./setup.sh
```

This may take some time depending on your system and connection speed. It will also require you to enter your password to install new packages.

When you see a message similar to the following, setup is complete and you are ready to switch between PHP versions at will.

```
* Setup complete. You may now use the 'switch-to-php-*.*.sh' scripts.`
```

## Usage

Once setup is complete, you can easily switch between different PHP versions using the appropriately named scripts. Examples are shown below.

```
./switch-to-php-5.6.sh
./switch-to-php-7.0.sh
./switch-to-php-7.1.sh
./switch-to-php-7.2.sh
./switch-to-php-7.3.sh
./switch-to-php-7.4.sh
./switch-to-php-8.0.sh
./switch-to-php-8.1.sh
./switch-to-php-8.2.sh
```

This will alter the versions of PHP running in Apache and the command line. Your password will be required to enable/disable Apache modules, restart the web server and alter the default PHP CLI version.

## Verification

If you wish, you can check that the switch was completed successfully.

You can verify the command line version of PHP has changed with the following command.

```
php -v | grep PHP
```

You can check the version of PHP running in Apache by creating a new PHP file, that calls the `phpinfo()` method, then accessing it via a web browser. An example is shown below.

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```
